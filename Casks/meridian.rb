  caveats <<~EOS
    Meridian is not yet code-signed, so macOS blocks it on first launch:
      * macOS 14 and earlier: right-click the app -> Open -> Open.
      * macOS 15 (Sequoia) and later: System Settings -> Privacy & Security ->
        scroll to the "meridian was blocked" notice -> Open Anyway.
